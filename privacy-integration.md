# Privacy Integration (Optional)

TaskNet and VerdictNet are designed to compose with privacy-focused agent skills.

## Motivation
- Prevent MEV and copy-trading
- Protect agent strategies
- Enable safe execution of high-value tasks

## Example Flow
1. Agent calls privacy skill (e.g. shielded transfer)
2. Agent executes TaskNet task
3. VerdictNet verifies outcome

This layer is optional and does not change core protocol logic.
